            Market, Chinatown and Queen West.</p>

            <h2 id="sports">Sports</h2>
            <p>Growing up in Alexandra Park, I grew up surrounded by sports facilities and athletes. Within less than a
                block from my house there's a basketball court, a hockey rink, a skate park, a soccer field and 2
                community centres. Naturally, I also got into sports and mainly played hockey as well as
                basketball and a bit of soccer. </p>
